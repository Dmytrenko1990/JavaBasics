Operators:
    Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition,subtraction we can
    compate things if two entities are same or a number is greater than the other number.
    There are three types of operators. They are Arithmetic operators, Relational operators and Logical
    operators.
Arithmetic operators:
    We use to perform simple math operations. Like additions, subtractions....
    + =>addition;
    - =>subtruction;
    / =>devision;
    * =>multiplication;
    % =>modulus, remained
Relational operators:
    Use to compare two quantities or entities. For example if somethings bigger then other thing
    or if two numbers are same or not or if two boolean variables contain same values or not
    == => use to check if two variables contain the same value or not if same we get true otherwise we get false
    != =>  use to check if two variables do not contain the same value. we get true if they are not same
    > =>  use to check if one value is greater than other value or not if greater we get true
    <  =>  use to check if one value is smaller than other value or not if smaller we get true
    >= if value on the left is greater than value on right side or if they are same we will get a true
    <=  it opposite of >= and it used to check if something is less than or equal to onother thing
Conditional constructs
    used to write conditional code. A piece of code that execute based on a condition is true that java execute
    the code otherwise it skips that code.
    if(condition)
    {any line of code even another if condition
    if() {
    }
    }

    If else condition
    When we have to test same varible for mult cond i sould use If else If
    When we i have mult conditions and these conditions are dependent on each other Nested If conditions
