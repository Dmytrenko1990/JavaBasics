constructor- block of code similar to a method
that is executed when we create an Object.

Why do we need it? - constructor initializes the object

How to create a constructor?
1.Constructor name MUST be same a class
2.No return type

Type of the constructors:
non argument
parametrized

this key word - is used to refer to the current object
    this. can be used with variable and methods
    this. used to refer to the instance variable
    In situation when local var has the same name with as instance ->
    we use .this to differentiate and refer to the instance var
this can be used to refer to refer to the instance method as well
this() - can used to call CURRENT class constructor
